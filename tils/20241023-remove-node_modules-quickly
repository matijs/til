# Remove node_modules quickly

A super fast way to remove all `node_modules` directories in a mono repository
is `git clean -Xdf` in the root of the worktree.

`-f` is pretty much always needed to make git actually remove something, unless
`clean.requireForce` is set to `false`.

`-d` is used to recurse into untracked directories which is necessary because
there is no other pathspec.

`-X` is used to only remove files that are ignored by git which `node_modules/`
usually is. Apparently some people apparently even have `node_modules` under
version control so milage may vary..

# A bit of jq

```shell
jq --raw-output \
    '.dependencies|keys|join(" ")' \
    path/to/package.json
```

This will get all the keys (the package names) of all dependencies that are in
package.json and output them as a raw string (`--raw-output`) to be used by for
example npm or pnpm.

```shell
jq --raw-output \
    '.dependencies|keys|map(select(startswith("@some/package")))|map(.+"@latest")|join("
    ")' package.json
```

This will get all the keys (the package names) of all dependencies in
package.json that start wih "@some/package" and output them as a raw string
(`--raw-output`) to be used by for example npm or pnpm to update all these
packages to their latest versions
